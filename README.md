This API server was created after a hard-felt need of an out of the box and ready to use solution everytime a project was being initiated.
This API server has been helping us for a long time. Thus, we decided to make it available to public and specifically for people who find it difficult or annoying to create the basic API structure each time a project is started.

A generic User model with JWT-based authentication has been included and the user registration and login/logout routes are already implemented in this API server.

Feel free to download and use as per your needs.

And don't forget to give credits where due! 

Happy coding! (◕‿◕)
